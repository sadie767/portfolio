    <p class="am">I currently live in Portland, Oregon and am attending Epicodus, a vocation training program for computer programmers. I live with my 3 year old son, Sebastian, and my cat Justine.  I have Bachelors degree in film from the University of Utah where I graduated as Outstanding Student of my class.  I have taught Bikram Yoga for 12 years and previously had danced with Utah Regional Ballet II for 3 years.  I love rock and roll and have djed at various clubs in Salt Lake City, Utah on and off for 16 years.
