    <h2 class="am">About me:</h2>
    <p class="am">I currently live in Portland, Oregon and am attending Epicodus, a vocation training program for computer programmers. I live with my 3 year old son, Sebastian, and my cat Justine.  Sebastian is the <em>love</em> of my life.
    </p>
    <h2 class="bg">Backgound:</h2>
    <p class="bg">I have a Bachelors degree in film from the University of Utah where I graduated as Outstanding Senior of my class.  I danced with Utah Regional Ballet II for 3 years and have taught Bikram Yoga for 12 years.  I volunteered as a programmer for Salt Lake City Film Festival for 3 years and have volunteered as theater staff at the Sundance Film Festival for the past 12 years.
    </p>
    <h2 class="hi">Hobbies/Interests:</h2>
    <p class="hi">I love rock and roll and have djed at various clubs in Salt Lake City, Utah off and on for 17 years.  I love to practice yoga and will eventually study plant medicine to learn about creating balance in the systems of the body.
    </p>
    <p class="ol">In this order, I enjoy spending my free time</p>
    <ul class="ol">
      <li>Goofing around with Sebastian</li>
      <li>Watching art films (particularly in the theater)</li>
      <li>Listening to music and discovering new bands</li>
