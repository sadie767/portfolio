    <h3>Epicodus training:</h3>
    <p>With only one week of training, I have created these fantastic websites:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="file:///Users/Guest/Desktop/vacation/vacation/index.html">Dream Vacation</a>
      <p>In this project we were required to create a site that displayed our dream vacation.  Using HTML and CSS the tasks were tailored to Bootstrap and included; creating containers, using a Jumbotron, using blockquotes, and using helper classes.</p>
      </li>
      <li><a href="file:///Users/Guest/Desktop/resort/resort_project/index.html">Justine's Resort</a>
      <p>In this project we were required to create a site that advertised a resort.  Using HTML and CSS the tasks were to have a main home page that linked to 5 different webpages of information about that resort.
      </p>
      </li>
      <li><a href="file:///Users/Guest/Desktop/interior/interio/interior.html">Design by Michelangelo</a>
      <p>In this project we were required to create a site that advertised an interior design company.  Using HTML and CSS the tasks were to use columns to display "before", "during", and "after" photos of the company's work.
      </p>
      </li>
      <li><a href="file:///Users/Guest/Desktop/cupcakes/cupcake-site/index.html">Cupcakes</a>
      <p>In this project we were required to create a site that advertised a cupcake shop.  Using HTML the tasks were to add photos and links to the website.
